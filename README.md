# PersonalAssistent
It's an Personal Assistent developed in C++ using espeak library file.

1.2 Problem Statement
We are all well aware about Cortana, Siri, Google Assistant and many other virtual
assistants which are designed to aid the tasks of users in Windows, Android and
iOS platforms. But to our surprise, there’s no such virtual assistant available for
the users who actually want to use them own customized and secure virtual assistant.
To fulfil this need we are here to design the customized virtual assistant just in the way the
Marvel Cinematic Universe shows the personal assistants of Iron Man Character.
By this the user do not need to worry about the data leakage problem or risk because this
assistant is fully native to the users system and the whole development is required to be
performed on the users system although its capacities are limited to a certain limit but continuous
work is to be carried out for make it better day by day

1.3 Objective
Main objective of building personal assistant software (a virtual assistant) is using
semantic data sources available on the web, user generated content and providing knowledge
from knowledge databases. The main purpose of an intelligent virtual assistant is to answer
questions that users may have. This may be done in a business environment, for example, on the
business website, with a chat interface. On the mobile platform, the intelligent virtual
assistant is available as a call-button operated service where a voice asks the user “What can I do
for you?” and then responds to verbal input. Virtual assistants can tremendously save you time.
We spend hours in online research and then making the report in our terms of understanding. JIA
can do that for you. Provide a topic for research and continue with your tasks while JIA does the
research. Another difficult task is to remember test dates, birthdates or anniversaries. It comes
with a surprise when you enter the class and realize it is class test today. Just tell JIA in advance
about your tests and she reminds you well in advance so you can prepare for the test. One of the
main advantages of voice searches is their rapidity. In fact, voice is reputed to be four times
faster than a written search: whereas we can write about 40 words per minute, we are capable of
speaking around 150 during the same period of time15. In this respect, the ability of personal
assistants to accurately recognize spoken words is a prerequisite for them to be adopted by
consumers.
